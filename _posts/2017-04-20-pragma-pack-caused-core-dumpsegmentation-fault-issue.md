Today is a long day because my colleagues and I spent lots of times debugging. We've tried to use v4l2 to capture image from camera and display using OpenCV.

But we met a problem is no matter how we call any cv functions, the program wentÂ core dump kind of crash. Finally we solved it by tracking a class using
```c++
#pragma pack(1)
```

It's the way to **guide compiler to pack structure with specific alignment** (let processor easier to grab data with less access).
 
**Note**: The default pack is 16 under x64 bit processor now.
