First, you may see eclipse installation shown on [this article]("./install-eclipse-for-android-app-on-mac-android-sdk")

and install it step by stepÂ on [Setting up Automatic NDK Builds in Eclipse](https://docs.google.com/file/d/0Byi-_2EfWbtGWTVFT3pSZEdqUG8/edit)

Then you may use it!

But if you encountered some <span style="color: red">error</span> such as <br>
**"no rule to make file"** in
debugging existing program provided by somebody.<br>
You can delete the **"local"** folder of
the **obj** folder of the project folder.<br>
